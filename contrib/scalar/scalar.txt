DESCRIPTION
-----------

Scalar is an opinionated repository management tool. By creating new
repositories or registering existing repositories with Scalar, your Git
experience will speed up. Scalar sets advanced Git config settings,
maintains your repositories in the background, and helps reduce data sent
across the network.

An important Scalar concept is the enlistment: this is the top-level directory
of the project. It contains the subdirectory `src/` which is a Git worktree.
This encourages the separation between tracked files (inside `src/`) and
untracked files (outside `src/`).

The command implements various subcommands, and different options depending
on the subcommand. With the exception of `clone` and `list`, all subcommands
expect to be run in an enlistment.

The following options can be specified _before_ the subcommand:

-C <directory>::
    Before running the subcommand, change the working directory. This
    option imitates the same option of linkgit:git[1].

-c <key>=<value>::
    For the duration of running the specified subcommand, configure this
    setting. This option imitates the same option of linkgit:git[1].

COMMANDS
--------

Clone
~~~~~

clone [<options>] <url> [<enlistment>]::
    Clones the specified repository, similar to linkgit:git-clone[1]. By
    default, only commit and tree objects are cloned. Once finished, the
    worktree is located at `<enlistment>/src`.
+
The sparse-checkout feature is enabled (except when run with `--full-clone`)
and the only files present are those in the top-level directory. Use
`git sparse-checkout set` to expand the set of directories you want to see,
or `git sparse-checkout disable` to expand to all files (see
linkgit:git-sparse-checkout[1] for more details). You can explore the
subdirectories outside your sparse-checkout by using `git ls-tree HEAD`.

-b <name>::
--branch <name>::
	Instead of checking out the branch pointed to by the cloned repository's
    HEAD, check out the `<name>` branch instead.

--[no-]single-branch::
	Clone only the history leading to the tip of a single branch,
	either specified by the `--branch` option or the primary
	branch remote's `HEAD` points at.
+
Further fetches into the resulting repository will only update the
remote-tracking branch for the branch this option was used for the initial
cloning. If the HEAD at the remote did not point at any branch when
`--single-branch` clone was made, no remote-tracking branch is created.

--[no-]full-clone::
    A sparse-checkout is initialized by default. This behavior can be turned
    off via `--no-full-clone`.

--[no-]fetch-commits-and-trees::
    The default behavior is to clone all commit and tree objects, with blob
    objects being fetched on demand. With the `--no-fetch-commits-and-trees`
    option, commit and tree objects are also fetched only as needed.

List
~~~~

list::
    To see which repositories are currently registered by the service, run
    `scalar list`. This command, like `clone`, does not need to be run
    inside a Git worktree.

Register
~~~~~~~~

register [<enlistment>]::
    Adds a repository to the list of registered repositories. If
    `<enlistment>` is not provided, then the enlistment associated with the
    current working directory is registered.

Unregister
~~~~~~~~~~

unregister [<enlistment>]::
    Remove the specified repository from the list of repositories
    registered with Scalar. This stops the scheduled maintenance and the
    built-in FSMonitor.

Run
~~~

scalar run ( all | config | commit-graph | fetch | loose-objects | pack-files ) [<enlistment>]::
    Run the given maintenance task (or all tasks, if `all` was specified).
    Except for `all` and `config`, this subcommand simply hands off to
    linkgit:git-maintenance[1] (mapping `fetch` to `prefetch` and
    `pack-files` to `incremental-repack`).
+
These tasks are run automatically as part of the scheduled maintenance,
as soon as the repository is registered with Scalar. It should therefore
not be necessary to run this command manually.
+
The `config` task is specific to Scalar and configures all those
opinionated default settings that make Git work more efficiently with
large repositories. As this task is run as part of `scalar clone`
automatically, explicit invocations of this task are rarely needed.

Reconfigure
~~~~~~~~~~~

After a Scalar upgrade, or when the configuration of a Scalar enlistment
was somehow corrupted or changed by mistake, this command allows to
reconfigure the enlistment.

With the `--all` option, all enlistments currently registered with Scalar
will be reconfigured. This option is meant to to be run every time Scalar
was upgraded.

Diagnose
~~~~~~~~

diagnose [<enlistment>]::
    When reporting issues with Scalar, it is often helpful to provide the
    information gathered by this command, including logs and certain
    statistics describing the data shape of the current enlistment.
+
The output of this command is a `.zip` file that is written into
a directory adjacent to the worktree in the `src` directory.

Delete
~~~~~~

delete <enlistment>::
    This command lets you delete an existing Scalar enlistment from your
    local file system, unregistering the repository and stopping any file
    watcher daemons (FSMonitor).
