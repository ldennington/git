NAME
----
scalar - an opinionated repository management tool

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
scalar clone [--single-branch] [--branch <main-branch>] [--full-clone]
         [--no-fetch-commits-and-trees] <url> [<enlistment>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Scalar is an opinionated repository management tool. By creating new
repositories or registering existing repositories with Scalar, your Git
experience will speed up. Scalar sets advanced Git config settings,
maintains your repositories in the background, and helps reduce data sent
across the network.

An important Scalar concept is the enlistment: this is the top-level directory
of the project. It contains the subdirectory `src/` which is a Git worktree.
This encourages the separation between tracked files (inside `src/`) and
untracked files (outside `src/`).

The command implements various subcommands, and different options depending
on the subcommand. With the exception of `clone` and `list`, all subcommands
expect to be run in an enlistment.

The following options can be specified _before_ the subcommand:

-C <directory>::
    Before running the subcommand, change the working directory. This
    option imitates the same option of linkgit:git[1].

-c <key>=<value>::
    For the duration of running the specified subcommand, configure this
    setting. This option imitates the same option of linkgit:git[1].

COMMANDS
--------

Clone
~~~~~

clone [<options>] <url> [<enlistment>]::
    Clones the specified repository, similar to linkgit:git-clone[1]. By
    default, only commit and tree objects are cloned. Once finished, the
    worktree is located at `<enlistment>/src`.
+
The sparse-checkout feature is enabled (except when run with `--full-clone`)
and the only files present are those in the top-level directory. Use
`git sparse-checkout set` to expand the set of directories you want to see,
or `git sparse-checkout disable` to expand to all files (see
linkgit:git-sparse-checkout[1] for more details). You can explore the
subdirectories outside your sparse-checkout by using `git ls-tree HEAD`.

-b <name>::
--branch <name>::
	Instead of checking out the branch pointed to by the cloned repository's
    HEAD, check out the `<name>` branch instead.

--[no-]single-branch::
	Clone only the history leading to the tip of a single branch,
	either specified by the `--branch` option or the primary
	branch remote's `HEAD` points at.
+
Further fetches into the resulting repository will only update the
remote-tracking branch for the branch this option was used for the initial
cloning. If the HEAD at the remote did not point at any branch when
`--single-branch` clone was made, no remote-tracking branch is created.

--[no-]full-clone::
    A sparse-checkout is initialized by default. This behavior can be turned
    off via `--no-full-clone`.

--[no-]fetch-commits-and-trees::
    The default behavior is to clone all commit and tree objects, with blob
    objects being fetched on demand. With the `--no-fetch-commits-and-trees`
    option, commit and tree objects are also fetched only as needed.
