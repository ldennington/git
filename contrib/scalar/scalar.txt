NAME
----
scalar - an opinionated repository management tool

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
scalar <command> [<options>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Scalar is an opinionated repository management tool. By creating new
repositories or registering existing repositories with Scalar, your Git
experience will speed up. Scalar sets advanced Git config settings,
maintains your repositories in the background, and helps reduce data sent
across the network.

An important Scalar concept is the enlistment: this is the top-level directory
of the project. It contains the subdirectory `src/` which is a Git worktree.
This encourages the separation between tracked files (inside `src/`) and
untracked files (outside `src/`).

The command implements various subcommands, and different options depending
on the subcommand. With the exception of `clone` and `list`, all subcommands
expect to be run in an enlistment.

The following options can be specified _before_ the subcommand:

-C <directory>::
    Before running the subcommand, change the working directory. This
    option imitates the same option of linkgit:git[1].

-c <key>=<value>::
    For the duration of running the specified subcommand, configure this
    setting. This option imitates the same option of linkgit:git[1].
